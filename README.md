## !Mideo, Terror, Espanto!

One of fandom's tastiest mid-century bootleggers was Mexico City's Editora Sol, who in the early ’60s published unauthorized reissues of EC Comics, then barely five years dead. This demo presents panels from two translations, Feldstein and Wood's race melodrama “The Whipping” (as “El Castigo”) and Krigstein's hallucinatory “You, Murderer” (as “Asesino.”) Both are swiped from the same issue of <i>Shock SuspenStories</i> famously debated by EC publisher Bill Gaines and psychiatrist Frederic Wertham before Senate Subcommittee in 1954.
